# Gist - Dynamic Syntaxing

Before even starting the Phoenix Server you need to Run your pistgres container

  * Run your postgres container on any open port you have and update the details of your container in `./config/dev.exs`.
  * Move to starting your Phoenix server in the next point.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
